5314369	Six things colleges don't want you to know about financial&nbsp;aid	Libby Nelson	<p>Most financial aid isn't really about helping students pay for college.</p> \n<p>Instead, it's part of an elaborate strategy colleges use to attract the students they want, admit the students they need and encourage others to stay away.</p> \n<p>Federal grants <a href="http://trends.collegeboard.org/student-aid/figures-tables/distribution-pell-grant-recipients-family-income-and-dependency-status-2010-11">overwhelmingly go to poor students</a>. But scholarships and grants offered by colleges themselves <span>&mdash; </span><span>which account for 19 percent of all financial aid</span><span> </span><span>&mdash; </span><span>are all over the map. Private colleges pioneered grants and financial aid offers to boost rankings and attract the wealthy, but in an era of shrinking state budgets, public colleges are increasingly likely to play the same game. And that's only the beginning of what colleges don't mention about financial aid.</span></p> \n<h3>Whether you need financial aid could affect whether you get into college</h3> \n<p><img src="http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4238897/480125373.jpg" class="photo" alt="480125373"><span></span></p> \n<p class="caption">George Washington University made headlines this year for lying about its need-aware admissions policies.<i style="color: #6f96a8; font-size: 0.8em; text-align: inherit; line-height: 1.5;"> </i><span>Astrid Riecken/The Washington Post/Getty Images</span></p> \n<p><span>This is especially true for students who are teetering on the edge of admission, who end up on a wait list, or who are trying to transfer. Admitting students without considering whether they can pay is considered the gold standard of college admissions. It's how things work for in-state students at public colleges, which tend to have lower tuition. But at private colleges, it's rare, and getting rarer: Of the 1,600 private nonprofit colleges in the U.S., few admit students without considering family income at all.</span></p> \n<p>Transfer students, wait-listed students and international students are the most likely to have financial need considered at some point. This happens even at selective, wealthy universities with huge endowments. Brown University and Vanderbilt University, to name two, both consider transfer students' financial need in admissions decisions.</p> \n<p>It might be common, but that doesn't mean it's popular. When George Washington University <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/george-washington-university-has-for-years-claimed-to-be-need-blind.-its-no">said last year</a> it had lied about taking students' need into account in admissions, it caused an uproar.</p> \n<p><span>Admissions officers say financial need is rarely the determining factor and is most likely to affect students who would just barely make it in otherwise. (At George Washington, admissions officers </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/inside-the-admissions-process-at-george-washington-university/2014/03/22/f86b85fa-aee6-11e3-a49e-76adc9210f19_story.html">said</a><span> only a few borderline students will be affected this year.)</span></p> \n<h3><span>A college that promises to meet a student's financial needs isn't promising a debt-free education</span></h3> \n<p><img alt="Screen_shot_2014-04-04_at_7" class="photo" src="http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4244201/Screen_Shot_2014-04-04_at_7.22.18_PM.png"><span>Instead, they're promising a financial aid "package" &mdash; including grants, which don't have to be paid back, and </span><a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://www.vox.com/cards/student-debt/what-is-a-student-loan">loans</a><span>, which do &mdash; that covers the difference between the price of tuition and the family's expected contribution. Even if colleges meet their full need, students whose parents are paying for college could still be required to borrow up to $31,000 in federal loans over the course of a four-year degree.</span></p> \n<p><a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://www.vox.com/cards/student-debt/what-kinds-of-student-loans-are-there">Federal loans</a> do have to be paid back, with interest. But they're considered financial aid because they're handed out without a<span> credit check and at lower rates than students would pay a bank or credit-card company.</span></p> \n<p>Federal loans are the largest share of financial aid: $101.5 billion annually, dwarfing the $32.3 billion in federal Pell grants, $44.4 billion in colleges' own grants and scholarships, and $9.7 billion in state grants handed out each year.</p> \n<p><span>Many colleges, though, don't promise to meet a student's full financial need. Like admitting students without regard to their financial situation, it's a promise many can't afford to make. Students at those colleges are likely to have to </span><a href="http://www.vox.com/cards/student-debt/how-much-debt-does-the-average-student-have">borrow even more</a><span>. .</span></p> \n<h3><span>&lsquo;Merit' aid isn't just for the smart kids</span></h3> \n<p><img alt="Screen_shot_2014-04-04_at_7" class="photo" src="http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4244249/Screen_Shot_2014-04-04_at_7.46.23_PM.png"></p> \n<p>Say a college has $30,000 to give away in financial aid. It can either use that money cover the full price for one low-income student, or flatter five with $6,000 "scholarships" who can pay the rest themselves. The latter is much better for the college's bottom line.</p> \n<p>That's a big, unspoken role for aid not based on financial needs:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/how-state-schools-ramp-up-aid-for-the-wealthy-leaving-the-poor-behind">enticing students</a> to attend one college rather than another.  Sometimes those awards are true scholarships, given to students with impressive achievements or who have high grades and test scores that will help a college raise its academic profile and climb in the influential <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i> rankings.</p> \n<p>The University of Rochester was unusually candid in a <a href="http://blog.enrollment.rochester.edu/blog/blog-admin/what-kind-of-scholarship-can-i-get">2011 blog post</a> on the factors that go into its merit aid program. The biggest bonus was, essentially, for just showing up: Students who had "serious" conversations and filled out all their financial aid paperwork received thousands of dollars more.</p> \n<p>Some recipients of merit aid are below average academically. One in 5 college students with combined SAT scores below 700 &mdash; out of a possible 1600 &mdash; received "merit" aid in 2007, <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2012/2012160.pdf">according to the National Center for Education Statistics</a>. So did more than one-quarter of students with SAT scores below 1000. And so did one in five students with below a C average in college.</p> \n<p><span>Some of those awards might recognize talents in areas other than academics (athletic scholarships, for example, often go to athletes with relatively low SAT scores). But many are small scholarships meant to attract students who can afford to pay the rest, writes the New America Foundation's Stephen Burd, who has studied the growth of merit aid at the expense of need-based aid.</span></p> \n<p>"In a lot of cases, they are trying to get full-pay students," Burd said, calling the practice "affirmative action for the rich."</p> \n<h3><span>The goal of a financial aid package might be to persuade you not to come</span></h3> \n<p><img alt="461096025" class="photo" src="http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4239075/461096025.jpg"></p> \n<p><span></span></p> \n<p class="caption">John Greim/LightRocket via Getty Images</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p><span>In the world of college admissions and aid, this is called an "admit-deny," an enrollment manager </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/11/the-best-class-money-can-buy/304307/">told <i>The Atlantic</i></a><span> in 2005: Let a student in, but offer a financial aid package so meager they'd be crazy to accept it. Colleges can leave a wide gulf between financial aid offers and the price of tuition &mdash; far too wide to be filled with federal loans alone.</span></p> \n<p>Admitting students without offering them enough aid to meet their need is common: 55 percent of all colleges, and 65 percent of private colleges, said they do so, according to a <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/survey/feeling-heat-2013-survey-college-and-university-admissions-directors">survey</a> of admissions directors. (Two-thirds said they thought it was an ethical practice.)</p> \n<p>In some cases, colleges expect families to take out additional <a href="http://www.vox.com/cards/student-debt/what-kinds-of-student-loans-are-there">private loans</a>. In other cases, they expect that the poor financial aid package will dissuade them from coming at all. The problem is that not all families get the message, and end up taking on tens of thousands of dollars of debt each year.</p> \n<h3><span>The federal government helps high-earning families pay for college too.</span></h3> \n<p><img alt="Screen_shot_2014-04-04_at_8" class="photo" src="http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4244297/Screen_Shot_2014-04-04_at_8.04.42_PM.png"></p> \n<p><span>But don't look for it on a financial aid award letter. Pell Grants go overwhelmingly to poor students: Most recipients come from families making less than $40,000 per year. That's led to criticism that the government doesn't do enough to help middle-income families, who are also worried about affording college.</span></p> \n<p>Middle-class and wealthy families, though, benefit from tax credits and deductions for tuition payments and student loan interest. (There's also a tax advantage for college savings.) Total tax credits and deductions for higher education expenses will add up to about $34 billion this year &mdash; slightly larger than the Pell Grant program. There is some overlap between the two programs: Some students receive both Pell Grants and tax credits, particularly the American Opportunity Tax Credit, which is refundable.</p> \n<p>The average benefit from tax credits is smaller than the average Pell Grant: about $1,330 per recipient, compared with more than $3,000 per recipient on average for a Pell Grant. <a href="http://trends.collegeboard.org/student-aid/figures-tables/distribution-education-tax-credits-agi-2011">But wealthier families benefit more</a>. Families making between $100,000 and $180,000 get the most annually, an average of almost $2,500 in tax benefits, according to the College Board.</p> \n<h3>How much you take out in loans might not be how much you pay back.</h3> \n<p><img alt="152599449" class="photo" src="http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4239115/152599449.jpg"></p> \n<p><span></span></p> \n<p class="caption">Citing bank bailouts, student protesters call for student debt cancelations. The Education Department does forgive some loans through income-based repayment. David McNew/Getty Images</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p><span>Here's a form of after-the-fact financial aid that doesn't show up before students enroll. The Education Department's </span><a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://www.vox.com/cards/student-debt/what-is-income-based-student-loan-repayment">income-based student loan repayment programs</a><span> remain something of a well-kept secret despite an intense outreach campaign.</span></p> \n<p>Those programs, which are available only for federal student loans, base monthly payments on borrowers' incomes. Borrowers pay for up to 20 years (10 if they work at a nonprofit or government agency). Either they pay back the amount they borrowed plus interest, or the remaining balance is forgiven.</p> \n<p>That means if borrowers take on a lot of debt, then can't find a job or go into a low-paying career, their monthly payments are lower than they'd be under a standard repayment plan. If they're doing well, they pay off their loans quickly. (There's no risk that they will pay back more than they owe.) If they continue to struggle, the loans will eventually be forgiven.</p>	2014-03-26 18:11:33	2014-03-26 20:29:45	2014-04-14 13:46:10	2014/3/26/5550328/what-colleges-wont-tell-you-about-financial-aid
5314475	Air pollution now kills 7 million people per&nbsp;year	Brad Plumer	<p>Air pollution killed roughly 7 million people in 2012, making it one of the leading causes of death on the planet. That's according to <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/air-pollution/en/">new data</a> from the World Health Organization, which found that dirty air is now responsible for one in eight deaths worldwide.</p> \n<p><q class="right" aria-hidden="true">More than half of those deaths were due to indoor air pollution</q></p> \n<p>More than half of those premature deaths, 4.3 million, were attributable to indoor air pollution, largely fumes from<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/post/what-cook-stoves-tell-us-about-the-limits-of-technology/2012/05/08/gIQApp8YAU_blog.html"> coal- or wood-burning cookstoves</a> in places like Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Africa.</p> \n<p>Another 2.7 million premature deaths were tied to outdoor air pollution, mainly in the cities of East Asia and South East Asia. The researchers linked this pollution to fatal conditions like like heart disease, strokes, or lung cancer.</p> \n<p>There's some good news and bad news here: A separate <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)61766-8/fulltext">study</a> in the journal <i>Lancet</i> last year found that indoor air-pollution deaths have actually declined in recent decades, thanks to efforts to promote cleaner cookstoves. But on the flip side, outdoor air pollution is now one of the fastest-growing health risks in the world. (Air pollution officially killed just 800,000 people worldwide in 1990, although measurements were much cruder back then.)</p> \n<p>A separate <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=82087&amp;eocn=home&amp;eoci=iotd_title">recent mapping effort</a> from NASA's Earth Observatory pinpointed the areas where premature deaths from outdoor air pollution have risen (in brown) and fallen (in blue) over the past century:</p> \n<p><img src="http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4408663/pollution_excess_deaths_lrg.png" class="photo" alt="Pollution_excess_deaths_lrg"></p> \n<p class="caption">NASA</p> \n<p><span>One big reason that outdoor air pollution keeps getting worse is that countries like China and India are growing rapidly. On the whole, that's excellent news. It means, for instance, that more people can afford to drive cars and trucks in cities like Beijing and Delhi. But it also means more fine particle pollution that can bury deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream. High levels of soot </span><a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/news/2012/08/10/12007/soot-pollution-101/" style="background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;">have been linked</a><span> to everything from asthma to heart attacks to death.</span></p> \n<p>That trend isn't expected to halt stop anytime soon. China currently has one car <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/post/one-billion-vehicles-hit-the-road-are-we-ready-for-two-billion/2011/08/22/gIQA1am4WJ_blog.html">for every 17.2 people</a>. In the United States, there's one car for every 1.3 people. If China were to catch up with the U.S. car ownership rate, the country would field a billion vehicles all by itself.</p> \n<p>Still, that doesn't have to entail inevitable death from pollution. Studies have found that when countries reach a certain point of development, its citizens start demanding cleaner air and water and push for stricter pollution controls. There are <a href="http://science.time.com/2012/12/20/unbreathable-air-pollution-becomes-a-major-global-killer/">plenty of cities</a> in Europe with much higher rates of car ownership than Delhi but lower levels of pollution. Cleaning up the air is perfectly doable, it just tends to cost extra.</p>	2014-03-26 18:35:08	2014-03-26 20:05:31	2014-08-04 16:01:44	2014/3/26/5550434/air-pollution-now-kills-7-million-people-each-year
5315709	The Border Patrol has a big problem with excessive&nbsp;force	Dara Lind	<p><span>The US Border Patrol has a problem. And the face of that problem is Esteban Manzanares.</span></p> \n<p>Manzanares, a Border Patrol agent, was on duty along the Rio Grande in March <a target="_blank" href="http://www.themonitor.com/breaking/border-patrol-agent-attacks-family-with-knife-kidnaps-girl-kills/article_c92ea728-aac1-11e3-8d91-0017a43b2370.html">when he came across</a> a Honduran woman and two girls who had crossed the river illegally. Instead of apprehending them, he sexually assaulted the woman and her 14-year-old daughter, slashed the mother's wrists, and tried to break the teenager's neck. Then he abducted the other daughter and tied her up in his home before returning to finish his shift.</p> \n<p>By the time the FBI was on his trail, Manzanares had killed himself. But the incident called attention to abuse and violence among Border Patrol agents at the worst possible time for the agency.</p> \n<p><img src="http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242141/77179630.jpg" class="photo" alt="77179630"></p> \n<p class="caption">A memorial for an immigrant who died crossing the border. David McNew/Getty</p> \n<p><q class="right"><span>the full, leaked report showed what officials who oversee border patrol had been trying to hide</span></q></p> \n<p>A few weeks earlier, the press had gotten hold <a target="_blank" href="http://articles.latimes.com/2014/feb/27/nation/la-na-border-killings-20140227">of the unredacted version of an independent report </a>conducted last year on shooting incidents involving Border Patrol agents. The government had released a censored version last fall, but the leaked, full report showed what the officials who oversee Border Patrol had been trying to hide. There were cases of agents stepping into the path of cars trying to escape custody in order to justify shooting at them, and cases of agents firing across the border at Mexicans who were throwing rocks.</p> \n<p><span>The resulting public outcry forced the Border Patrol to issue a few new directives to its agents. But the policy tweaks couldn't assuage the worry that has slowly been building among residents of both sides of the border for years. </span><span>How often do Border Patrol agents escalate situations or initiate violence? And what is the agency doing about it?</span></p> \n<h3>More agents, more misconduct</h3> \n<p>Misconduct among Border Patrol agents, especially on the southwestern border, has become a more pressing concern in the last several years simply because there are so many more agents.</p> \n<p>US Customs and Border Protection, the agency that oversees the Border Patrol, was ordered by Congress to put more boots on the ground on the southwest border — both at road crossings to check people entering the country legally (those are called "ports of entry," and are operated by the agency directly) and along the border between those spots, to catch people entering illegally. The latter is Border Patrol's job.</p> \n<p>From 2005-2012, the number of Border Patrol agents on the US-Mexico border increased by over two-thirds:</p> \n<p><img alt="Screen_shot_2014-05-30_at_1.20.49_pm" class="photo" src="http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4536525/Screen_Shot_2014-05-30_at_1.20.49_PM.png"></p> \n<p>And that hiring spree wasn't accompanied by more funds for employee oversight. With limited resources, Customs and Border Protection focused on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gao.gov/assets/660/650505.pdf">preventing corruption</a> among border guards and keeping up with a Congressional <a target="_blank" href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/s3243">mandate</a> to issue polygraph tests to all new hires, not monitoring agents' use of violence.</p> \n<p><q class="left"><span>an unarmed teenager in Nogales, named Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez, </span><span>was shot</span><span> 10 times by agents firing through the border fence</span></q></p> \n<p>The good news is that corruption hasn't become a systemic problem. There have been a <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/phoenix/press-releases/2013/corrupt-border-patrol-agent-sentenced-to-five-years-in-prison" target="_blank">couple of cases</a><span>,</span><span> but the rate of agents being reported for corruption </span><a target="_blank" href="http://www.gao.gov/assets/660/650505.pdf">hasn't increased at all</a> <span>throughout the hiring surge. (Among other things, the Border Patrol's policy of stationing agents at least 100 miles from their home appears to have helped keep corruption low.)</span></p> \n<p>But while their agency minders weren't looking, the Border Patrol has developed an excessive-force problem. The Arizona Republic <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/politics/articles/20131212arizona-border-patrol-deadly-force-investigation.html" target="_blank">found </a>that at least 42 people were killed by Border Patrol agents since 2005. In 2010, a man named Anastasio Hernandez Rojas <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/02/us/02border.html?_r=0">died</a> in Border Patrol custody after being tased. In 2012, an unarmed teenager in Nogales, named Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez, <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/politics/articles/20131212arizona-border-patrol-deadly-force-investigation.html">was shot</a> 10 times by agents firing through the border fence. After a PBS<b> </b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/video/need-to-know-july-20-2012-crossing-the-line-part-2/14271/">documentary</a><b> </b>on the Rojas death, including cellphone video footage of his tasing, emerged in 2012, Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) <a href="https://serrano.house.gov/sites/serrano.house.gov/files/DHSIGletter.pdf" target="_blank">asked</a> the Department of Homeland Security to investigate. He wanted to know how the Border Patrol's use-of-force policy was being implemented — and what happened to agents who used excessive force.</p> \n<p>At the time, Border Patrol didn't actually have a category in its internal reporting system for use-of-force incidents. It didn't seem to be a big concern. So government inspectors had to make some educated guesses, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oig.dhs.gov/assets/Mgmt/2013/OIG_13-114_Sep13.pdf"><b>ultimately identified</b> </a> 1,187 "possible" excessive force incidents between 2007 and 2012, including 136 involving a fired weapon. At the same time, an outside group, the Police Executive Research Forum, conducted an external review of 67 shooting incidents over the same period, 19 of which resulted in death. That was the review that was published in redacted form, along with the government's report, in September.</p> \n<p><img alt="450285247" class="photo" src="http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4241405/450285247.jpg"></p> \n<p class="caption">A Border Patrol agent. John Moore/Getty</p> \n<p><span>Customs and Border Protection agency standards theoretically require Border Patrol agents to use "the lowest level of force necessary" to resolve any situation. However, the old standards said that "because of unique circumstances and individual differences in every potential confrontation," it's okay for two different agents to have different reactions to the same scenario.</span></p> \n<p><span>That standard makes it difficult to tell when management decides that an agent has crossed the line. The </span><a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2014/feb/27/nation/la-na-border-killings-20140227" target="_blank">press reports of the unredacted Police Executive Research Forum review</a><span>, which came out in February,</span><span> showed Border Patrol agents doing things most people wouldn't consider a "reasonable" response. </span><span>The review found cases of agents intentionally putting themselves into the path of cars that were trying to flee, to create "justification for the use of force." It also included cases of Border Patrol agents shooting at rock throwers in Mexico, through the border fence.</span></p> \n<h3>Why can't Border Patrol keep its agents in line?</h3> \n<div class="align-right"> \n<p><img width="300" src="http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4241235/141619456.jpg" class="photo" alt="141619456"></p> \n<p class="caption">A Border Patrol agent coordinates with a helicopter crew. (John B. Carnett/Popular Science)</p> \n</div> \n<p>In fairness, it's possible that in some of these cases, the Border Patrol itself found that the use of force was not justified and took internal action. "Agents are subjected to incredible scrutiny," an attorney for the Border Patrol agents' union <a target="_blank" href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/politics/articles/20131212arizona-border-patrol-deadly-force-investigation.html">told</a> the Arizona Republic. "But the process is exceedingly opaque."</p> \n<p><span>But there's just no public evidence of Border Patrol ever disciplining its employees for excessive use of force. When the </span><span>Arizona Republic </span><span></span><a href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/politics/articles/20131212arizona-border-patrol-deadly-force-investigation.html" style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;">looked</a><span> into the 42 Border Patrol killings, it couldn't find public record of any of those agents being disciplined. </span></p> \n<p><span></span>When agency officials have gotten involved in excessive-force controversies, it's been to issue an "official" account of what really happened that exonerates their agents - despite evidence to the contrary.</p> \n<p>The agency claimed, for example, that Hernandez Rojas (the man whose killing inspired the use-of-force investigation to begin with) was acting aggressively after being tased. Yet the Arizona Republic reported that "cellphone videos showed him begging for help, face-down on the ground, as a dozen agents shocked and struck him."</p> \n<p dir="ltr">When the uncensored independent review of shootings <a target="_blank" href="http://articles.latimes.com/2014/feb/27/nation/la-na-border-killings-20140227">was leaked</a> by the Los Angeles Times, the Border Patrol tried to limit the fallout. Its commissioner issued policies that were slightly more restrictive: Agents are now required to have a "reasonable belief" that a car is using deadly force in order to shoot at it. Agents can only shoot at rock-throwers when threatened with "imminent danger of death or serious injury." Yet even these modest changes were unacceptable to the agents' union. When the new policies were announced in March, the Border Patrol union's <a href="http://us3.campaign-archive1.com/?u=023b13d50aaacdd04f9a1226d&amp;id=9810e9ec01">official statement </a>began with an excerpt from the story of David and Goliath. The message: Rocks can be lethal weapons, and agents should be empowered to respond in kind.</p> \n<p>But the Border Patrol may not be able to fend off oversight for good — especially after Agent Esteban Manzanares attacked the three Honduran women last month.

5317047	7 charts that show how Americans spend their&nbsp;time	Danielle Kurtzleben	<p>Every day, Americans average a little more than half an hour making food, 43 minutes socializing and communicating, and about 11 minutes doing lawn and garden care. We know this because of the American Time Use Survey, a ridiculously detailed trove of data the Labor Department maintains. The department just released a new batch of this data on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>If this doesn't sound exactly like how you spend your day, it's because those data contain multitudes: students, retirees, and stay-at-home parents, for example, in addition to working people. Drilling down gives a better picture of what Americans do all day.</p> \n<h3>How all of America spends its time</h3> \n<p><img alt="Screen_shot_2014-06-18_at_12.10.00_pm" class="photo" src="http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4635159/Screen_Shot_2014-06-18_at_12.10.00_PM.png"></p> \n<p>Not many people's days look exactly like this — 3.5 hours of work, 5.3 hours of leisure time — because this takes into account everyone 15 and older, including retirees and college students, as well as both weekdays and weekends. But take this chart as a big insight into how all of America spends its time. As a nation, we spent one-third of last year sleeping and around 50 percent more time having fun than working. But we also spent more time doing housework, like cleaning and making food, than we did actually consuming that food.</p> \n<h3>What a workday looks like</h3> \n<p><img alt="Screen_shot_2014-06-18_at_3.40.50_pm" class="photo" src="http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4635185/Screen_Shot_2014-06-18_at_3.40.50_PM.png"></p> \n<p>This is a glimpse into a typical weekday for some of the busiest Americans: working parents. They're not quite getting eight hours of sleep per weeknight, and they're spending a little over an hour a day focused on caring for their kids and others.</p> \n<h3>Dads work way more than moms...except not really</h3> \n<p><img alt="Screen_shot_2014-06-18_at_12.56.18_pm" class="photo" src="http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4635193/Screen_Shot_2014-06-18_at_12.56.18_PM.png"></p> \n<p>Among adults 18 and older, women spend far less time <i>at</i> work than men — even among full-time workers — but more time doing things like housework and cooking.</p> \n<p>This trend is pronounced among parents of young children. Among fathers and mothers who have kids 6 and younger, dads spend, on average, almost one more hour at the office per day than moms (this includes part-time workers and both weekdays and weekends, hence the 5- and 6-hour workdays). But add in housework, childcare, and shopping, and moms end up working almost as much as dads. That said, dads also relax more, getting 40 minutes more leisure time per day, on average, than moms. Moms, meanwhile, get slightly more sleep and also spend slightly more time on educational activities, like going to school or doing homework.</p> \n<h3>There are complicated links between education and time use</h3> \n<p><img alt="Screen_shot_2014-06-18_at_1.05.37_pm" class="photo" src="http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4635225/Screen_Shot_2014-06-18_at_1.05.37_PM.png"></p> \n<p>Interestingly, time use varies a lot by educational attainment. Above are four areas where the trend is most pronounced. People with lower educational attainment spend more time doing leisure activities, sleeping, and keeping house, while people with more education tend to be at work more. There are other patterns as well — more educated Americans also tend to spend slightly more time eating and drinking, as well as talking on the phone or using email.</p> \n<p>There are all sorts of reasons why these patterns show up, but one key one might be that working pattern. Less-educated people tend to have a harder time finding work than more-educated Americans, which would naturally lead to fewer working hours and more hours for other activities. Likewise, it's possible some of the more educated Americans who have jobs are putting in long hours — extremes on both ends can skew these averages.</p> \n<h3>We watch a lot of TV</h3> \n<p><img alt="Screen_shot_2014-06-18_at_3.25.00_pm" class="photo" src="http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4635233/Screen_Shot_2014-06-18_at_3.25.00_PM.png"></p> \n<p>Americans watch far more TV in their downtime than doing anything else. Of the 5.26 hours per day Americans had for leisure time on average in 2013, we spent most of it watching TV. Nothing else even comes close, whether it's being on the internet, exercising, or reading. Why tackle <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Naked_and_the_Dead">The Naked and the Dead</a>, after all, when you can watch <a target="_blank" href="http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/naked-and-afraid">Naked and Afraid</a>?</p> \n<h3>...and youngsters aren't reading</h3> \n<p><img alt="Screen_shot_2014-06-18_at_1.25.56_pm" class="photo" src="http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4635249/Screen_Shot_2014-06-18_at_1.25.56_PM.png"></p> \n<p>When we do have free time, the older we are, the more likely we are to read. Even on weekends and holidays, when there was more abundant free time, teenagers 15 to 19 only read for around 4 minutes a day. The oldest Americans, meanwhile, read for more than an hour a day. These data only include reading for fun, however, which may be why the count for the student-age population is strangely low.</p> \n<h3>The kids seem to love their internet</h3> \n<p><img alt="Screen_shot_2014-06-18_at_1.44.11_pm" class="photo" src="http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4635257/Screen_Shot_2014-06-18_at_1.44.11_PM.png"></p> \n<p><span>One thing young Americans are doing instead of reading books appears to be going online. As of 2013, Americans age 15 to 19 spent far more time playing games and being on the computer for fun than any age group of adults 35 and older. Granted, this category includes any sort of games, so it could mean teenagers and young adults are spending a lot of time playing Clue or Parcheesi (or, more likely, they're playing video games). And even if they are online, they might be reading insightful news articles...but it may also just mean they're </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;" target="_blank" href="http://trololololololololololo.com/">wasting time</a><span>.</span></p>	2014-03-27 13:15:14	2014-04-11 19:30:03	2014-06-19 12:38:42	2014/4/11/5553006/how-americans-spend-their-time-in-6-charts
5319731	Welcome to Vox: a work in&nbsp;progress	Ezra Klein, Melissa Bell, Matt Yglesias 	<p>Welcome to Vox.com! Again!</p> \n<p>On March 9, we launched Vox.com, which included our first videos, and we started talking to readers on our <a href="http://facebook.com/vox">Facebook page</a> and on our <a href="https://twitter.com/voxdotcom">Twitter feed</a>. Today marks phase two of Vox&rsquo;s launch: the beginning of our effort to build the vast repository of information that will make it possible for us to explain the news in real time.</p> \n<p>At the core of this phase are the Vox Cards. They&rsquo;re inspired by the highlighters and index cards that some of us used in school to remember important information. You&rsquo;ll find them attached to articles, where they add crucial context; behind&nbsp;<a href="http://www.vox.com/cards/ukraine-everything-you-need-to-know/what-is-the-ukraine-crisis">highlighted words</a>, where they allow us to offer deeper explanations of key concepts; and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare/what-is-obamacare">in their stacks</a>, where they combine into detailed &mdash; and continuously updated &mdash; guides to ongoing news stories. We&rsquo;re incredibly excited about them.</p> \n<p>But we're just starting to learn how to use them. We have been employees of Vox Media for less than 65 days. The product team began work on the site seven weeks ago. Most of our staff started three or four weeks ago. Some people haven&rsquo;t even been here a full week. Several key positions remain unfilled. But we didn&rsquo;t want to wait a day longer than necessary to launch the site.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden="true" class="center">the quicker we CAN launch, <br>the quicker we CAN start learning</q></p> \n<p>We&rsquo;re launching this fast for one simple reason: there is no better way to figure out the best way to do explanatory journalism on the web than to do explanatory journalism on the web.</p> \n<p>We have some exciting ideas about how to do a better job explaining the news. But right now, those ideas are untested with the audience. And that's the only test that matters. Our theory is simple: the quicker we can launch, the quicker we can start learning &mdash; and start improving.</p> \n<p>The site we have today isn't perfect, and it isn't anywhere near complete &mdash; not editorially, and not technologically. Poking around this evening, or this week, or this month, you may notice a few things seem missing. We don't have commenting features on most articles. We don't have a menu bar. We're woefully lacking in snazzy data visualizations. We have some card stacks on key topics in the news, but there are many, many more left to build.</p> \n<p><q class="right" aria-hidden="true">We'll always be a work in progress</q></p> \n<p>That's not because community or navigation or graphics or context aren't important to us. It's because they're important enough to us that we don't want to do them badly. We&rsquo;re working on them and when we feel comfortable that we're delivering a certain level of quality, we&rsquo;ll release our ideas into the wild and test, refine, and improve them.</p> \n<p>At the same time, we didn't want to delay the parts of the site we had ready. We're launching today because three more weeks or three more months or 30 more months will not produce a perfect website. We&rsquo;ll always be a work in progress.</p> \n<p>But we're excited about what we have now, and we&rsquo;re excited about what we&rsquo;ll roll out in the weeks and months to come. Most of all, we&rsquo;re eager for you to see what we do have so we can learn what&rsquo;s useful to you and what isn&rsquo;t. And then we can get better at explaining the news.</p> \n<p>You can reach us at <a href="mailto:editors@vox.com">editors@vox.com</a>.</p> \n<p>Let&rsquo;s get started.</p>	2014-03-27 23:36:18	2014-03-30 20:18:56	2014-04-07 00:57:01	2014/3/30/5555690/welcome-to-vox
5321211	Bitcoin is down 60 percent this year. Here's why I'm still&nbsp;optimistic.	Timothy B. Lee	<p>The markets haven't been kind to<span> </span><a href="http://www.vox.com/cards/bitcoin/" style="font-size: 17px; line-height: 28.4624996185303px;">Bitcoin</a> in 2014. The currency reached a high of nearly $1,000 in January before falling to around $350 this month, a plunge of more than 60 percent. It would be easy to write Bitcoin off as a fad whose novelty has worn off.</p> \n<p>After all, dollars seem superior in almost every respect. T<span>hey're accepted everywhere, they're convenient to use, and they have a stable value. Bitcoin is an inferior currency on all three counts.</span></p> \n<p><q class="right"><span>Bitcoin's detractors are making the same mistake as many Bitcoin fans</span> </q></p> \n<p><span>Yet it would be foolish to write Bitcoin off. The currency has had months-long slumps in the past, only to bounce back. </span>More importantly, it's a mistake to think about Bitcoin as a new kind of currency. W<span>hat makes Bitcoin potentially revolutionary is that it's the world's first completely open financial network.</span></p> \n<p><span>History suggests that open platforms like Bitcoin often become fertile soil for innovation. Think about the internet. It didn't seem like a very practical technology in the 1980s. But it was an open platform that anyone could build on, and in the long run it proved to be really useful.</span></p> \n<p>The internet succeeded because Silicon Valley have created applications that harness the internet's power while shielding users from its complexity. <span>You don't have to be an expert on the internet's TCP/IP protocols to check Facebook on your iPhone.</span></p> \n<p>Bitcoin applications can work the same way. There are already some Bitcoin applications that allow customers to make transactions over the Bitcoin network without being exposed to fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin's currency. That basic model should work for a wide variety of Bitcoin-based services, allowing the Bitcoin payment network to reach a mainstream audience.</p> \n<p><img src="http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4215235/imp.jpg" class="photo" alt="Imp"></p> \n<p><span><span></span></span></p> \n<p class="caption">This is the very first node on the ARPANET, the predecessor to the Internet that launched in 1969. (Flickr/<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fastlizard4/6294438012/">FastLizard4</a>)</p> \n<p><span></span></p> \n<h3><span>The first open financial network</span></h3> \n<p>The Bitcoin network serves the same purpose as mainstream payment networks such as Visa or Western Union. But there's an important difference. The Visa and Western Union networks are owned and operated by for-profit companies. If you want to build a business based on one of those networks, you have to get permission from the owner.</p> \n<p>And that's not always easy. To use the Visa network, for example, you have to comply with <a href="https://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/visa-international-operating-regulations-main.pdf">hundreds of pages</a> of regulations. The Visa network also has high fees, and there are some things Visa won't let you do on its network at all.</p> \n<p>Bitcoin is different. Because no one owns or controls the network, there are no limits on how people can use it. Some people have used that freedom to do illegal things like buying drugs or gambling online. But it also means there's a low barrier to entry for building new Bitcoin-based financial services.</p> \n<p>There's an obvious parallel to the internet. Before the internet became mainstream, the leading online services were commercial networks like Compuserve and Prodigy. The companies that ran the network decided what services would be available on them.</p> \n<p><span>In contrast, the internet was designed for anyone to create new services. Tim Berners-Lee didn't need to ask anyone's permission to create the world wide web. He simply wrote the first web browser and web server and posted them online for others to download. Soon thousands of people were using the software and the web was born.</span></p> \n<h3>Finding Bitcoin's killer app</h3> \n<p>So what will people do with Bitcoin? It's hard to predict tomorrow's innovations, but we can get some idea of Bitcoin's potential by thinking about weaknesses of the conventional financial system.</p> \n<p><q class="left"><span>Bitcoin is such a good deal for merchants that they may find it worthwhile to offer their customers discounts for paying with Bitcoin instead of cash or credit cards</span></q></p> \n<p>One obvious application is international money transfers. Companies like Western Union and Moneygram can charge as much as 8 percent to transfer cash from one country to another, and transfers can take as long as 3 days to complete. In contrast, Bitcoin transactions only take about 30 minutes to clear, and Bitcoin transaction fees could be a lot less than 8 percent.</p> \n<p>People have been <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vox.com/2014/11/1/7139785/there-are-now-285-bitcoin-atms-around-the-world">building Bitcoin ATMs</a> to let people convert between bitcoins and their local currency. The first Bitcoin ATM was launched a little over a year ago. Today, there are <a target="_blank" href="http://coinatmradar.com/">329 of them</a>.</p> \n<p><span>If these devices continue to proliferate, they could become a useful alternative to conventional money-transfer services. Currently, each machine charges a transaction fee of around 3 percent, so the total cost of transferring money from one Bitcoin ATM to another is around 6 percent. That's comparable to the fees charged by incumbent money transfer services, and competition is likely to push down Bitcoin ATM fees over time.</span></p> \n<p>A more ambitious application for Bitcoin would be as an alternative to credit cards for daily purchases. Startups such Bitpay have already figured out how to make Bitcoin attractive to merchants as a way of accepting payments. Credit card networks charge merchants around 3 percent to process transactions. Bitpay charges 1 percent or less to accept Bitcoin payments on behalf of merchants. Bitpay merchants don't have to worry about the headache of disputed payments known as "chargebacks."</p> \n<p><span>Of course, for Bitcoin to take off as an alternative to credit cards, consumers will have to start using them regularly. And that's going to be a hard sell, especially if consumers are exposed to the risk of Bitcoin's volatility.</span></p> \n<p>But a Bitcoin-based payment app could also have some advantages. One is security. The current credit card network essentially works on the honor system, allowing any merchant to charge a credit card and relying on after-the-fact adjudication to police fraud. Bitcoin could allow companies to experiment with alternative approaches that build in security at the front end, for example by asking users to confirm a transaction on their smartphones before it's approved. That could cut fraud, reducing the hassle of disputing fraudulent payments and allowing lower fees.</p> \n<p>Moreover, Bitcoin is such a good deal for merchants that they may find it worthwhile to offer their customers discounts for paying with Bitcoin instead of cash or credit cards. That might entice bargain-hunting consumers who aren't otherwise interested in trying a new payment technology.</p> \n<p><img src="http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4215267/6355318323_4c41d3ef76_b.jpg" class="photo" alt="6355318323_4c41d3ef76_b"></p> \n<p class="caption"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/68751915@N05/6355318323/sizes/l" style="font-size: 12px; font-style: italic; line-height: 15px;">401(K) 2013</a></p> \n<h3><span>Using Bitcoin-the-network without Bitcoin-the-currency</span></h3> \n<p>The biggest stumbling block for many Bitcoin services is Bitcoin's volatility. The current generation of Bitcoin "wallet" apps, which store bitcoins on behalf of users, expose consumers to fluctuations in Bitcoin's value. Ordinary consumers are unlikely to ever be comfortable with a payment system where their wealth can shrink by 10 percent or more in a single day.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, it's possible to design Bitcoin-based financial services that don't expose users to fluctuations in Bitcoin's value. Bitpay is a good example. Bitpay merchants set prices in conventional currencies such as the dollar, converting to the equivalent number of Bitcoins at the time of sale. Once the sale is made, Bitpay immediately converts it to an equivalent number of dollars and deposits the cash in the merchant's conventional bank account. This means that from the merchant's perspective, Bitpay is just another way of accepting dollars. A Bitpay merchant isn't affected at all by fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin.</p> \n<p>The same principle could apply to any other Bitcoin-based service. A consumer-friendly payments app could store a user's cash in dollars, converting them to bitcoins at the time of payment. Under the hood the app could use the full power of the Bitcoin platform, but from the user's perspective it would just seem like another way of paying for things with dollars.</p> \n<p>You're probably wondering: if Bitcoin's value is as a payment network, why not just build an open payment network based on a conventional currency like the dollar? An open, dollar-based payment network would be a great idea. The problem is that no one has figured out how to build one.</p> \n<p>Dollars in the Paypal network are worth a dollar because the Paypal company has promised to honor withdrawal requests. But there's no organization to perform this role on a peer-to-peer network like Bitcoin.</p> \n<p>Suppose there were a network called Dollarcoin that worked exactly like Bitcoin except a company called Dollarcoin Inc. promised to convert dollarcoins into dollars. Then the value of one dollarcoin would always equal one dollar. But as the manager of the Dollarcoin network, the Dollarcoin company would face pressure to comply with a variety of laws regarding fraud, money laundering, and so forth. To keep the costs of complying with those requirements under control, it would be forced to regulate who could use the network and how. (Indeed, that's exactly what <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-PayPal-Wars-Battles-Planet/dp/1936488590">happened to Paypal</a> 15 years ago.) Over time, the Dollarcoin network could become as restrictive as conventional financial networks.</p> \n<p>Bitcoin's openness depends on the fact that no one owns the network. And with no owner, there's no one to guarantee that bitcoins have a predictable value.</p> \n<p>Many of Bitcoin's early adopters were acolytes of Ron Paul's brand of hard-money libertarianism. They were attracted to the promise of a currency whose supply was outside of state control, and as a consequence, Bitcoin has gained a reputation as the second coming of the gold standard. That, in turn, has made mainstream economists who are hostile to Ron Paul and the gold standard hostile to Bitcoin.</p> \n<p>But in reality, the case for Bitcoin simply doesn't have much to do with its unorthodox monetary policy. Bitcoin is a payment network that happens to have its own currency, not the other way around. It's worth taking seriously whether or not you agree with Ron Paul's views on the Federal Reserve.</p>	2014-03-28 13:24:28	2014-03-31 14:01:30	2014-12-16 16:37:36	2014/3/31/5557170/bitcoin-bad-currency-good-network
5321741	6 health problems marijuana could treat better than traditional&nbsp;medicine	German Lopez	<p>Twenty states have so far legalized the medical use of marijuana, and researchers are starting to look at how, exactly, patients can put those laws to the best use.</p> \n<p>There's a burgeoning field of research exploring what medical conditions marijuana is best suited to treat — and how, in certain cases, it might actually outperform traditional medicine. But the evidence remains quite limited, largely as a result of prohibition and strict federal oversight of medical research.</p> \n<p>"Millions of patients are using this plant, and we need to understand it," says Sue Sisley, a doctor and researcher at the University of Arizona. "It is negligent for these 20 states to go selling cards to marijuana patients without actively conducting rigorous medical marijuana research that's necessary."</p> \n<p><q class="center">"Millions of patients are using this plant, and we need to understand it"</q></p> \n<p>Sisley wants to study marijuana as a treatment for military veterans with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), but it took until March — <a href="http://www.maps.org/research/mmj/timeline/">nearly four years after the study's conception</a> — for the study to get federal approval. First, she needed the Food and Drug Administration to sign off. Then, her team waited three years for approval from the Public Health Service to obtain legal marijuana supplies. <span>(No other </span><a href="http://www.justice.gov/dea/druginfo/ds.shtml">schedule 1 drug</a><span> </span><span>needs the extra round of approval,</span><span> </span><a href="http://www.maps.org/media/view/press_release_public_health_service_blocks_fda-approved_medical_mariju/">according to Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies</a><span>.)</span></p> \n<p>"It's a long process," Sisley says. "And we believe the only reason we got the Public Health Service approval, finally, was because of really strong advocacy from our veterans all over the country who were asking the federal government why they were blocking this research."</p> \n<p><span></span><span>Despite the difficulties, some marijuana research managed to get approval in the United States and other countries over the past few years. And the findings so far suggest a drug that holds the potential to treat some medical problems better than traditional medicine.</span></p> \n<h3><span>Pain</span></h3> \n<p><img src="http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4243637/482681757.jpg" class="photo" alt="482681757"></p> \n<p class="caption">Marijuana could relieve foot pain.

"In fact, we know very well that people with PTSD who use  marijuana — a potent cannabinoid — often experience more relief from  their symptoms than they do from antidepressants and other psychiatric  medications."</span></p> \n<p class="p3">It should come as little surprise, then, that the first person to buy recreational marijuana in Colorado was <span class="s2"><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/legal-recreational-pot-industry-opens-in-colorado-101660.html">Sean Azzariti</a>, an Iraq War veteran suffering from PTSD.

The Epilepsy Foundation argues the Drug Enforcement Agency should relax its classification for marijuana, which is currently marked as more dangerous than cocaine, to support more research.</p> \n<p>The problem isn't limited to just epilepsy, however. It's long been difficult to study marijuana due to federal restrictions. While this list is limited to six examples, it could certainly grow as legalization encourages doctors and researchers to take another look at a drug once marked as taboo.</p>	2014-03-28 15:23:50	2014-03-31 15:44:21	2014-11-17 00:20:33	2014/3/31/5557700/six-problems-medical-marijuana-might-treat-better-than-traditional
5325649	9 charts that explain the history of global&nbsp;wealth	Matthew Yglesias	<p>Thomas Piketty's book <i>Capital in the 21st Century</i> advances an important and provocative argument about the future of the world economy. <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/4/8/5592198/the-short-guide-to-capital-in-the-21st-century">You can read all about it here in our short guide to the book</a>. But the argument <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">is built</span> upon the most impressive set of data ever assembled about the history of wealth around the world, and that data <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">tells</span> many stories beyond the main narrative argument of the book. Here we present nine charts drawn from the book that illustrate the history of the global economy.</p> \n<h3><span>1) The fall and rise of Asia</span></h3> \n<p><img src="http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204525/World_Output.png" class="photo" alt="World_output">300 years ago, a majority of the world's economic output was located on the Asian continent. But with the coming of the Industrial Revolution, Europe's share of the global economy increased substantially. As European settled the Western Hemisphere and brought industrial economics with them, the Americas rose as well. Asia's share of world output shrunk massively, despite the continent's enormous population. But over the past 20-30 years, Asia's staged a massive comeback. Its share of world output isn't yet back to where it was in 1714 but it's getting close.</p> \n<h3><span>2) The return of inequality in Britain</span></h3> \n<p><img src="http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204533/capital_in_britain.png" class="photo" alt="Capital_in_britain">This chart shows the extent and nature of British wealth as compared to British income. In the 18th and 19th centuries, <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">wealth</span> was massive relative to income and much of it took the form of agricultural land. Over the course of the 19th century, the relative value of agricultural land shrunk and was largely replaced by "net foreign capital," i.e. British ownership of foreign assets during the heyday of the British Empire. Then came the world wars. The foreign capital was liquidated to pay for the wars, and domestic capital shrunk. Circa 1950 the power of accumulated wealth versus ongoing income reached a low point. But since 1970, wealth has made a comeback, powered considerably by an increase in the value of houses—primarily urban and suburban land in the London area.</p> \n<h3><span>3) The return of inequality in Germany</span></h3> \n<p><img src="http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204565/capital_in_germany.png" class="photo" alt="Capital_in_germany">The story of German wealth is different from the British story in almost every detail. "Net foreign capital," meaning German ownership of foreign assets, was not very important in the pre-World War I era. <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">Instead wealth</span> was driven overwhelmingly by "other domestic capital," meaning the value of German industrial and commercial enterprises. German wealth was, of course, massively destroyed by the world wars. But it's rebounded strongly since its low point. Interesting, despite Germany's vaunted industrial capabilities the rebound has <i>not</i> been driven by a large increase in domestic capital. Instead the key sectors are domestic housing and ownership of foreign assets.</p> \n<h3><span>4) America's age of equality</span></h3> \n<p><img src="http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204589/Capital_in_the_United_States.png" class="photo" alt="Capital_in_the_united_states">American economic history looks very different from Britain or Germany. We apparently enjoyed an edenic early period prior to 1880 in which accumulated wealth was small relative to ongoing income. This was a world in which a few years of hard work could, it seems, easily help you stack up against the might of the already wealthy. Many of America's enduring narratives about itself clearly owe a debt to this early period, even though the more recent trajectory has been different.</p> \n<h3> \n<div id="slaves"><span>5) The fall of the slaveholding aristocracy</span></div> \n</h3> \n<p><img src="http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204611/United_States_With_Slavery.png" class="photo" alt="United_states_with_slavery"></p> \n<p>The image of early 19th century America has a relatively egalitarian landscape turns out to neglect something important: slavery. Millions of people of African ancestry were held in bondage, making the idea of hard work as the ticket to success a joke. And possession of their labor was extremely valuable. As this chart illustrates, slave wealth was slightly more valuable than all the agricultural land in the country put together. It was also more valuable than all the factories and railroads and canals combined. In a world of relatively abundant land and high wages, owning black people was <i>the</i> key to wealth. And the process of emancipation was possibly the single greatest expropriation of wealth in human history.</p> \n<h3><span>6) The varieties of capitalism</span></h3> \n<p><img src="http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204627/market_value_and_book_value.png" class="photo" alt="Market_value_and_book_value">This chart is a little difficult to understand, but it's very deep. For several different countries, it compares the "market value" of their companies (i.e., what it would cost to buy all the shares of their stock) to the "book value" of the companies (i.e., the value of the factories, patents, offices, etc. that the companies own). This lets us see that in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom share prices are high relative to the book value of companies. The Anglophone countries have shareholder-friendly legal systems in which the owners of stock control enterprises. In Germany, stocks are much less valuable because the legal system gives much more weight to the interests of employees and other stakeholders. France is an intermediate case. These different conceptions of capitalism coexist with vast sums of wealth at stake in the difference between them.</p> \n<h3><span>7) The really really rich are different from you and me</span></h3> \n<p><img src="http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204659/income_composition.png" class="photo" alt="Income_composition">This chart shows that the vast majority of people in the top 10 percent of the American income distribution earn a living the way most of us do — they work for it. But among the top 0.1 percent and the top 0.01 percent things are different. Labor income — wages and salaries — are a distinct minority of total earnings. The truly rich don't get their money by working for high pay. They get their money as a consequence of their pre-existing wealth.</p> \n<h3><span>8) Wealth is much more unequal than income</span></h3> \n<p><img src="http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4207471/wealth_inequality.png" class="photo" alt="Wealth_inequality">You hear a lot about income inequality, but as this chart makes clear wealth inequality is <i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i>much </i>more severe. In the United States, just 1 percent of the population owns about 35 percent of all the wealth. Even in relatively egalitarian Europe, the top 1 percent owns around 25 percent of the wealth. In both continents, the top 10 percent owns over half the wealth. Near the bottom of the spectrum, wealth is typically negative as people have more in debt (whether because of student loans, credit cards, or underwater mortgages) than they have in assets.</p> \n<h3><span>9) The billionaires boom</span></h3> \n<p><img src="http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4207487/billionaires.png" class="photo" alt="Billionaires"></p> \n<p>We are living through a golden age of billionaires. In 1996 there were about 400 billionaires. That number has more than tripled. But the total wealth under the control of billionaires has grown even faster — over five-fold in less than two decades. The trend reflects both growing inequality in rich countries, and growing prosperity in China and other relatively poor ones. The point here is that not only is wealth held unequally, the inequality appears to be growing fractally with the very richest of the rich growing richer at the fastest pace.</p>	2014-03-29 18:57:31	2014-04-10 13:30:01	2014-12-16 15:47:02	2014/4/10/5561608/9-charts-that-explain-the-history-of-global-wealth
5327175	Remember when legal marijuana was going to send crime&nbsp;skyrocketing?	German Lopez	<p><span>When Colorado legalized recreational marijuana sales, Denver embraced the opportunity with open arms.</span></p> \n<p>The city is now home to more than 62 percent of all Colorado recreational marijuana retailers, who cashed in on <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/10/colorado-marijuana-tax-revenue_n_4936223.html">$14 million in sales</a> in January alone.</p> \n<p><span>Other cities weren't so eager: heeding legalization opponents'  safety concerns, several pushed off licensing retail sales. Some banned  retail sales altogether.</span></p> \n<p><span>"There will be many harmful   consequences," Douglas County Sheriff David Weaver warned in a September 2012 statement. </span><span>"Expect more  crime, more kids using marijuana, and pot for sale  everywhere."</span></p> \n<p><q class="center">"Thugs put on masks, they come to your house, they kick in your door. They point guns at you and say, 'Give me your marijuana, give me your money.'"</q></p> \n<p>One California sheriff <a href="http://denver.cbslocal.com/2013/02/11/sheriff-in-california-says-coloradans-will-regret-legalizing-marijuana/">went on Denver television</a> to warn that, as a result of marijuana in his county, "thugs put on masks, they come to your house, they kick  in your door. They point guns at you and say, 'Give me your marijuana,  give me your money.'"</p> \n<p><span>Three months into its legalization experiment, Denver isn't seeing a  widespread rise in crime. Violent and property crimes actually decreased  slightly, and some cities are taking a second look at allowing  marijuana sales.</span></p> \n<p>"We had folks, kind of doomsayers, saying, 'Oh my gosh, we're going  to have riots in the streets the day they open,'" Denver City Council  President Mary Beth Susman, a supporter of legal marijuana, says. "But  it was so quiet."</p> \n<h3>Denver's violent crime rate is holding steady</h3> \n<center> \n<p><img alt="Violent_crime_in_denver" class="photo" src="http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4262311/violent_crime_in_denver.png"></p> \n</center> \n<p>Denver's <a href="http://www.denvergov.org/police/PoliceDepartment/CrimeInformation/CrimeStatisticsMaps/tabid/441370/Default.aspx">crime data</a><span> shows a slight decrease in the past year: violent crime in January and February fell by 2.4 percent compared to the first two months of 2013.</span></p> \n<h3>Property crime is falling, too</h3> \n<center> \n<p><img src="http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4262319/Screen_Shot_2014-04-04_at_1.50.37_PM__1_.png" class="photo" alt="Screen_shot_2014-04-04_at_1"></p> \n</center> \n<p><span>Prior to legalization, </span><a href="http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_23763821/denver-das-version-violent-medical-marijuana-industry-questioned">opponents</a><b style="line-height: 1.5;"> </b><span>warned  property crime would rise. Denver District Attorney Mitch  Morrissey argued robbers would prey on marijuana businesses  and their customers, because they're more likely to carry cash (and, of course, the drug). </span></p> \n<p>So far, city data shows no increase in property  crime. Compared to the first two months of 2013, property crime in  January and February actually dropped by 12.1 percent. Reports of  robberies and stolen property dropped by 6.2 percent and 13 percent,  respectively. Burglaries and criminal mischief to property rose by only  0.5 percent.</p> \n<p>Denver residents don't seem especially concerned with the issue,  either. Susman recalls a recent community meeting she held with senior  citizens: when she asked if the crowd wanted her to talk about  marijuana, people told her they were tired of hearing about the issue.</p> \n<p>"Based on my general understanding in my district, it is becoming ho-hum," Susman says.</p> \n<h3>Three months is still a short time frame</h3> \n<p><span> </span></p> \n<p><img src="http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236449/459964349.jpg" class="photo" alt="459964349"></p> \n<p class="caption">Recreational sales began in January. Theo Stroomer / Getty Images News</p> \n<p>Some groups caution that it's too early to tell whether legalization will cause public safety issues in the long term.</p> \n<p>"We quite frankly don't know," Smart Colorado spokesperson Henny  Lasley says. Her group, formed after legalization, focuses on keeping marijuana away from children. "We've had three complete months of retail marijuana. We  were getting those questions three days into legalization. It's a pretty  short window."</p> \n<p><span>Tom Gorman, director of </span><span>Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, thinks the</span><span> full effects  won't surface until, at best, three to four years. </span></p> \n<p>"This is a great opportunity for us to find out what happens when you  legalize a substance like marijuana," Gorman says. "Just wait and watch  what happens in these labs, and then you can make a decision based on  data and facts and not rhetoric."</p> \n<p>Some marijuana legalization opponents, on the other hand, have  adopted a softer opinion. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, who opposed  legalization, <a href="http://thelead.blogs.cnn.com/2014/01/24/how-has-legalization-of-marijuana-changed-denver/">told CNN</a> that the city's dive into recreational marijuana went smoothly. And  despite some concerns about property crime, he said the city saw  "nothing that has raised a major red flag."</p> \n<h3>Medical marijuana hasn't led to an increase in crime</h3> \n<p><img src="http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236429/98049962.jpg" class="photo" alt="98049962"></p> \n<p class="caption">Medical marijuana in California. Justin Sullivan / Getty Images News</p> \n<p>Outside of Colorado, most research on crime and marijuana looks at legalization for medicinal purposes. <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0092816">One study</a> published in PLOS ONE concluded the expansion of medical marijuana did not lead to more violent or property crime, and <a href="http://www.vox.com/explains/marijuana-legalization/what-is-medical-marijuana">medical marijuana</a> legalization might in fact correlate with a reduction in some crimes.</p> \n<p>Researcher Robert Morris suggests that taking marijuana purchases out of an illicit market could reduce crime overall. "Perhaps there's additional crime associated with the criminal  marketplace to begin with," he says.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, crime could decrease if people began substituting alcohol with marijuana. "We know there's a  pretty strong link between alcohol misuse and crime, particularly in a  person of violence," Morris says. "There's not as much of a correlation  between marijuana use and crimes."</p> \n<p>Still, Morris cautions that the potential for crime reduction needs  more study. He also says the findings don't necessarily apply to full  marijuana legalization, and he would like to study that issue in further  detail.</p> \n<h3>But concerns remain about businesses' cash holdings</h3> \n<p><img src="http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236413/143182883.jpg" class="photo" alt="143182883"></p> \n<p class="caption">People celebrating 4/20 in Denver. Marc Piscotty / Getty Images News</p> \n<p>If there's a reason for crime to increase following marijuana  legalization, it may be the fine line marijuana businesses walk between  legalization at the state level and criminality at the federal level.</p> \n<p>Many banks decline to open accounts for marijuana sellers since the  federal government still considers the drug illegal. As a result, many  marijuana businesses hold raw cash — sometimes tens of thousands of  dollars — from profits and to pay their bills. (The Obama  administration, for its part, <a href="http://www.vox.com/cards/marijuana-legalization/federal-government-deal-legal-marijuana">issued guidances</a> telling prosecutors and regulators to prioritize issues other than marijuana in states where the drug is legal. But banks <a href="http://www.aba.com/Press/Pages/021414FinCenGuidance.aspx">remain skeptical</a> without changes in the law itself.)</p> \n<p>Keeping cash on hand can be dangerous; a large stash of bills can be an easy target for crime. <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w19996">One study</a> from researchers at the University of Missouri at St. Louis and Georgia State University found raw cash in welfare programs can lead to higher crime rates due to its liquidity and anonymity in  transactions. Researchers found that Missouri counties that moved to electronic welfare benefits, from cash, saw crime drop by nearly 10 percent following the transition.</p> \n<p>Denver District Attorney Morrissey says the  amount of cash at marijuana businesses will near certainly lead to more crime.  "You hit a 7-Eleven in Denver, you might get $20 to $100," he said in an interview. "You hit a dispensary on a good day, who knows? You might get $30,000 in cash."</p> \n<p>City Council President Susman also worries the large amount of cash  flowing in and out of these businesses could become an easy target for  criminals.</p> \n<p>"A grow operation will have a $20,000 or $30,000 utility bill a  month," she says. "They have to show up at the utility's office with  $20,000 or $30,000 in a briefcase."</p> \n<h3>Other Colorado cities are following Denver's lead</h3> \n<p><img src="http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236503/98555840.jpg" class="photo" alt="98555840"></p> \n<p class="caption">Some cities aren't resisting this offer.
